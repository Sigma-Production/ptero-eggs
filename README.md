---

## 📦 Available Eggs

### 1. 🌐 Pterodactyl Webhost Egg
Easily deploy a web server with optional WordPress support.

#### 🔧 How to Use:
1. Download the JSON egg file from the releases page.
2. Import the egg into your **Pterodactyl panel**.
3. Create a new server.  
   - Optionally, enable **WordPress** during setup for automatic installation.  
4. Install **Composer** packages either during setup or afterward.
5. Access your server via the assigned IP and port.  
   - For WordPress: `http://ip:port/wp-admin`  
6. (Optional) Use a custom domain by setting up a **reverse proxy** on the host.

#### 📝 Disable Logs from Console:
To remove access/error logs from console output:
- Open `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
- Uncomment these lines:
  ```nginx
  #access_log /home/container/naccess.log;
  #error_log  /home/container/nerror.log error;
  ```

#### 🔧 Using Alternative Configurations (e.g., Nextcloud):
The repository includes alternative Nginx configurations in `nginx/conf.d/`:
- `default.conf` - General purpose web server configuration
- `nextcloud.conf` - Optimized configuration for Nextcloud installations

To use an alternative configuration:
1. Rename or remove `default.conf` (e.g., `mv default.conf default.conf.backup`)
2. Ensure your chosen configuration is active (e.g., `nextcloud.conf`)
3. Edit the `listen` directive to match your assigned port if needed
4. Restart the server

**Note:** Only one server configuration should listen on the same port to avoid conflicts.
